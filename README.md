# react_fetch_data
This project fetches emoji data.  There are categories: smileys_and_people, animals_and_nature, food_and_drink, travel_and_places, activities, objects, symbols, and flags.  The user my enter any of these values in the search field to return name, htmlCode and Unicode values for a listing of emojis.

This project demonstrates the following concepts: 
- use of React state and useEffect
- use of axios to fetch data
- fetching data from an external source


I had fun learning how to use React to display fetch data.

### How to Run
Anyone can run this file by downloading the repository, running a local file server like node http-server


### Future Improvements
Add a drop down list for the search text box and figure out how to display the emojis from the returned codes.
